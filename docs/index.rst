OpenGB
======

OpenGB is a 3D printer control interface.

OpenGB is designed for the `Open Gigabot`_ open-source 3D printer designed and built by `re:3D`_. It should also be compatible with other printers running `Marlin`_ firmware and a wider range of open-source firmware will be supported in the future.
